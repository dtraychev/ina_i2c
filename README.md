# SV ina219 with I2C master/slave
SystemVerilog Simple I2C master slave modules.
Example basic implementation of ina219 as a I2C slave DUT.

This is an experimental project with I2C master on TB side and I2C slave used with ina219 DUT. It is slightly tested, therefore proper functionality under all conditions cannot be guaranteed.
* I2C support write and read operations (without NACK)
* Few INA219 functionalities are done for demonstration purpose.
